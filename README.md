## Overview

Welcome to the Off-Platform Project: Tea Cozy, created as part of the Codecademy curriculum for the Full-Stack Engineering Path.

This project focuses on building a fictitious tea shop website on my computer. I was provided a design pace and image assets. I used basic HTML and CSS to complete this project. 
There was no single way to complete this project. 
This is one of the first websites I created.
